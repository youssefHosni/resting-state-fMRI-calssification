# AD_Classification
This project is about utilizint resting_state FMRI to classify patients with Alzheimer's disease form controls.
The project started on June 2019, as a part of summer internship in Oulu universtiy, in collaboration with Oulu-university 
hospital.

## Data
___
In this project Oulu university data where used for trainign the model and [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/) data were used in testing the performance.
The 4mm Brain mask that was used for extracting brain from scalp had been extracted using [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)

## Model
___
Coefficient of variation over time for BOLD signal was used as the input data for the model. The model Consists of three main 
steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing the input data
1. Voxel Selection using cross validation for creating mask of most effective voxels
1. Classify the masked data using many classifiers and printing the results (Gaussian process classifier provides the best 
performance in high dimensional space.

### Running the code
```python3
python3 main.py
```
Change input parameters and variables in the main.py file to fit your requirements and preferences
The default script runs under 10 minutes on an average laptop using under 1 GB of memory.

## Results
___
The results folder sould be created by you and give it name to the variable 'Results_directory' , it contains the measured performace in **Results.txt**, the used parameters and chosed classifier **README.txt**, mask of effective voxels, and voxel importance weight.
The provided pretrained model in **Output_results_directory** gives the following confidence level:

|          | Median | Min(.95 CL) | Max(.95 CL) |   
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | .702   | .555        | .835        |   
| F1_score | .723   | .595        | .841        |   
| AUC      | .781   | .721        | .856        |   

#### Note the mask and weights files images are in NIFTI format, you can use FSL utils or nibabel library to process the data or FSLeyes to visualize.
#### Note try always to get unique name for the *Results* directory (unique in your root directory)
